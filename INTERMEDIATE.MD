## Intermediate Sorting Algorithms
---

### Objectives
- Understand the limitations of the sorting algorithms we've learned so far.
- [Implement merge sort](MERGESORT.md)
- [Implement quick sort](QUICKSORT.md)
- Implement radix sort

---
### Why Learn This?
- The sorting algorithms we've learned so far don't scale well
- Try out bubble sort on an array of 100000 elements, it will take quite some time!

---
### Faster Sorts

- There is a family of sorting algorithms that can improve time complexity from (n^2^) to O(n log n)
- There is a trade off between efficiency and simplicity
- Ther more efficient algorithms are much less simple, and generally take longer to understand
- Let's dive in!
